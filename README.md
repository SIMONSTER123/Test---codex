## 🎯 How to Play

### Getting Started
1. **Open the game** in your web browser
2. **Wait for loading** - the city simulation will initialize
3. **Start building** your first roads and zones

### Basic Controls
- **Mouse**: Navigate the 3D view (click and drag to rotate)
- **Build Tool** (1): Place buildings and infrastructure
- **Bulldoze Tool** (2): Remove unwanted structures
- **Info Tool** (3): Get information about specific areas
- **Space**: Pause/unpause the game
- **Speed Controls**: Adjust simulation speed (1x, 2x, 3x)

### Building Your City

#### 1. Infrastructure First
- Start by building **roads** to connect your city
- Add **power lines** and **water pipes** for utilities
- Roads are essential - buildings won't develop without road access

#### 2. Zoning
- **Residential Zones** (🏠): Houses for your citizens
- **Commercial Zones** (🏢): Shops and businesses that generate income
- **Industrial Zones** (🏭): Factories that provide jobs and income

#### 3. Public Services
- **Power Plant** (🏭): Provides electricity to your city
- **Water Tower** (🗼): Supplies clean water
- **Hospital** (🏥): Keeps citizens healthy
- **School** (🏫): Educates the population
- **Fire Station** (🚒): Protects against fires
- **Police Station** (🚓): Maintains law and order

### Economic Management
- **Starting Budget**: $100,000
- **Income Sources**: 
  - Population taxes ($2 per citizen)
  - Commercial buildings (random $10-30)
  - Industrial buildings (random $15-45)
- **Expenses**:
  - Base maintenance: $50
  - Building maintenance: $5 per building
  - Service buildings: $20 each

### Happiness System
- **Base Happiness**: 50%
- **Service Bonuses**: +5% per service type (max +20% each)
- **Population Penalty**: -1% per 100 citizens over 1,000
- **Budget Impact**: -10% if budget below $1,000

## 🎯 Tips for Success

### City Planning
1. **Plan Your Layout**: Design road networks before zoning
2. **Balance Development**: Mix residential, commercial, and industrial
3. **Service Coverage**: Ensure all areas have access to services
4. **Monitor Budget**: Keep income higher than expenses
5. **Population Growth**: Build residential zones near services

### Advanced Strategies
- **Hub Design**: Create central service districts
- **Economic Zones**: Separate industrial areas from residential
- **Transportation**: Plan for future traffic flow
- **Expansion**: Grow gradually to maintain balance
- **Specialization**: Focus on specific city types (industrial, commercial, etc.)
